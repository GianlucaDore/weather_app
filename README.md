# About React Weather Widget

This project was made as a submission for Developer Enhancers. The goal was to create a weather app widget that resembled the specifications given.
The basic feature asked was to create a "This week/This month" infobox to display weather data for the week or for the month. The other parts of the UI are not made for interaction.

This is the Invisio app that needed to be implemented:

And these are some screens of the application developed;
